        <p>The Hindustani music has elements of ancient Hindu tradition, Vedic philosophy and Persian tradition as well. It has been influenced by various elements such as Arab, Persian, Afghan and Carnatic elements which have added a new dimension to Hindustani music. Classical Hindustani music also represents traditional Vedic texts where songs and verses have been passed down in written and oral form for centuries and are still used today for worship.
        </p>

        <p>The most influential musician from the Delhi Sultanate period was Amir Khusrau (1253-1325), sometimes called the father of Hindustani classical music. Most notably, he was the first to put the ghazal poetry of Iran to music, a style that remains incredibly popular among Muslims in the region today. Exponents of Hindustani classical music such as Ustad Bismillah Khan, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, and Ravi Shankar have been awarded with the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of India, for their contributions to the arts.

            <p>Hindustani classical music is known largely for its instrumentalists. Instruments most commonly used in Hindustani classical music are the sitar, sarod, tambura, sahnai, sarangi, and tabla.
