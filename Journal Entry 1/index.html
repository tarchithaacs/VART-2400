        <h4> J.R. Carpenter, <a href=https://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html> A Handmade Web </a> </h4>
        <p>To put forth something on the Internet has become a spoon-fed process. Carpenter’s dive into the history of the handmade web explores the loss of a journey to expression. With current template building tools, tools I have used myself to archive work or promote information, bringing my own ideas and design forward is done on a pedestal. While centering the user experience has become the driving force for websites, by doing so it has limited the everyday person in their own independence on the internet. The efforts taken to bridge the gap between knowing the nitty gritty code in order to contribute to the internet to simply publishing has been viewed as a benefit, one that makes the final act of expression accessible to everyone. While it may ring true for the non-coder and non-designer who wishes to also put their voice out there, these efforts were initiated for the sake or corporate marketing. Thus, the translation of templates, minimalism and commercialization into the digital web has replicated reality. Carpenter’s reflections confirmed to be that websites went from a new hope that they could be an anticapitalist effort that celebrated individuality, a new world free from limitations of class and corporate power to another exploitative gambit that discards art, culture, growth and humanity for efficiency in the least amount of time to sell ideas.</p>

        <h4>Laurel Schwulst, <a href="https://pb-fordham.github.io/web/pdfs/schwulst-mywebsiteisashiftinghouse.pdf"> My Website is a Shifting House</a></h4>


        <p>“The web is what we make it.” A simple but powerful reminder in a time where the web takes on anonymity and identity as the media. Schwulst’s exploration of the website as varying objects brings light to the forgotten and dismissed reality that a website does not need to be a subject. The freedom to be an architect and allow for creation to be simple and one-directional was outgrown with the rise of massive social media corporations. Schwulst’s nostalgic refresher feels like returning to a habit that makes one’s inner child delightful. She describes a tedious journey with satisfying results that could only be unique because of the individuality allowed at every step of the way. </p>

        <h4>Ursula K. Le Guin, <a href="https://pb-fordham.github.io/web/pdfs/leguin-technology.pdf"> A Rant on Technology</a></h4>

        <p>Le Guin’s rant is a beautiful ode to how far we have come and a nod to the everyday technologies that go unnoticed. As design students, we are constantly told that good design is one that is so effective that it is unnoticeable until we lack it. Le Guin’s frustrations over the definition of technology manipulated to exclude any technology that is not connected to a digital interface (or computers really) rings true almost 2 decades after publication. In a world where people are pushed to pursue any career in the “tech” industry for exponential financial growth and a powered-up starting point, it is clear that technology still follows a hierarchy that identifies “hi-tech” as the most valuable. The currency of our attention holds higher than anything else that could be tangibly provided and that has transformed what is recognized as valuable technology. Le Guin’s rant then acts not just as a reality check but also as a reminder to not forget the individuality that allowed us to come so far.</p>
