        <h4> Furthering Growth </h4>
        <p>Learning concrete skills in this class with html, css and javascript has assisted me in having more control over the design I can create. I truly find that having had the opportunity to explore these languages has given me autonomy in a way that was a bit overwhelming and terrifying at first, but as I’m nearing the class, I find this added autonomy as something I have regained.</p>
        
        <h4>Self-Satisfaction</h4>
        <p>I think for the most part I am satisfied with my work! As someone relatively new to my major as a senior, I sometimes feel behind in trying to play catchup in creating “good” design and having to spend more time learning the visual arts aspect of this class that many of my peers already have a trained eye for. However, I think considering the schedule I had this semester alongside various physical and mental health hurdles, the work I created during this class was the best I could have done at this time.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Changed Views</h4>
        <p>This class most definitely changed my views on art and technology, especially with the readings we often had to reflect on. While I always knew creating a website itself could be a form of artmaking, I think I dismissed that growing up in an age where the internet was already accepted while social media was developing. To now understand and engage in the building blocks of a website, I will probably forever spend the rest of my life as a designer, constantly trying to understand how some cool thing I see on a website works or have a newfound appreciation for visual culture propelled by digital media.</p>
        
        <h4>Moving forward</h4>
        <p>I most likely will continue using my skills in the future as I grow beyond Fordham! I truly was not expecting to enjoy coding but as I would work on assignments for this class I often found myself pulling all-nighters to make my vision come true and not being bothered in the slightest over losing track of time. I’m also working on a research project this year with one of my friends and I’m trying to see if I can apply these skills to that research, so at least one future project is already being planned :)</p>
        
        <h4>Final Remarks</h4>
        <p>Even though my grade is suffering a bit, I’m glad I took this class and learned all that I did! Also, I truly appreciate how thoroughly everything was explained to us and taught as I am taking another computer science class this semester that I would have been completely lost in if it was not for this class! I also enjoyed seeing everyone’s work in each class and it was inspiring to be surrounded by such ambitious peers.</p>
