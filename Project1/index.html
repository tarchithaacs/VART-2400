                <h1>THE SNOWY DAY</h4>
                <h3>Jack Ezra Keats</h5>
                    <p>
                        A charming book, "the snowy day" follows the wonnder and excitement of a young boy, Peter, as he experiences his first snow day in his neighbourhod. Visually assembled with illustrations,  cut-outs, watercolors, and collage, Keats narrates this tale in a cozy and warm color pallete filled with the overwhelming white and the iconic red onesie that Peter sports. According to a Scholastic description, "the little boy celebrates the snow-draped city with a day of humble adventures--experimenting with footprints, knocking snow from a tree, creating snow angels, and trying to save a snowball for the next day."

                <p>
                 Jack Ezra Keats (1916-1983) was a celebrated American author and illustrator of children's books. He grew up in a poor Jewish family with immigrant parents in Brooklyn, New York. Following his service in World War II, he changed his last name from Katz to Keats to avoid anti-semitism and to find work in the book publishing industry. He is best known for his diverse and inclusive storytelling, and "A Snowy Day" remains one of his most famous works. Keats received numerous awards for his contributions to children's literature and was known for paving the way for more inclusive and diverse children's literature.

                In 1963, this book would go onto recieve the Caldecott Medal. In an article by the Atlantic, it is recognized that, "the high-profile nature of the Caldecott Medal means that the book still has wide distribution, outlasting many of its contemporaries" and that "to this day, nearly every American library that houses children’s books buys at least one copy of The Snowy Day, making it widely available to young American readers everywhere." Keats's intention in creating The Snowy Day was to break down barriers. He wanted a book that would “lead all children to genuine self-acceptance.” He was deliberate about making Peter Black, while at the same time, seeking to present a protagonist who could be seen as any child, not defined by his skin color. A picture book starring a Black child, this story will come to be celebrated for the representation but <a href="https://www.slaphappylarry.com/the-snowy-day-by-ezra-jack-keats/?expand_article=1#google_vignette">some critics</a>
                have also brought up that the book is color-blind. The snippet below gives a preview of the book and follows a conversation on the legacy of The Snowy Day!

                    While this was a book that I did not come across until I was well into high school, the red onesie that Peter has on is adorable little illustration that is recignized immediately by most of my peers who grew up with this tale in the United States. The simplicity of focusing on the newfound experience for one child and the use of contrasting colors that make Peter an easy to recognize and draw by anyone are strengths of this book. In conversation with a friend recently, we reveled at the manner in Keats captured the emotions of enjoying a snow day which made us sad for future youth with tha decreasing snowfalls we have had in recent years. As an enviromentalist, I hope that climate inaction by politicans and corporations in power is halted to avoid the loss of snow days. The book is magical but for it to become a forgotten reality would be a a devastating blow to future childhoods.
