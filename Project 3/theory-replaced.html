            <h4>GREAT REPLACEMENT THEORY</h4>

            <h2 style="font-size:30px"> White Supremacy, Immigration, and Eugenics</h2>
            <br>

            <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 1">
                The idea is that strangers will overtake the United States via immigration, reproduction, and seizure of political power.

            <br>

            <p style="text-align:left; font-style: italic; line-height: 1">The latest version of this “white replacement theory,” argues that race is an important and consistent trait of nations and that “nonwhite populations are not only growing but conspiring to drive white people to extinction.”

            <br>

            <p style="text-align:right; font-style: italic; line-height: 1">Various white supremacists that have taken action through shootings have identified themselves as ecofascism, from Christchurch, New Zealand to Buffalo, New York.

            <br>

            <p style="text-align:right; font-style: italic; line-height: 1">News stories such as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/12/tucker-carlson-fox-news/603595/">littering or pollution being exclusively caused by “immigrants”</a>, to the blaming of other countries for global climate harm in order to justify the climate inaction in the U.S., as well as acceptance of population collapse by media outlets, are real-time effects of the rhetoric put forth by this theory.

            <p style=" text-align:left; color:#ff9405; font-style: italic; line-height: 1">This theory in conjunction with the fear of climate change churns out the idea that certain (often nonwhite) populations, within the US or internationally, are the primary cause of climate environmental issues.
